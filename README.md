# bookingexpress
A java application for Railway Management System to book tickets with a novel feature of passenger selecting the coach position and seat number. 

This project is created using JAVA GUI with SWINGS and AWT. I have used Mysql database here, also I have attached the screenshots of Database here.

These are all the java files which I have used under the package named nishit.
